# RuSH: Ray's Unremarkable SHell

This is intended as a learning experiment, I'm going to try and leave as many comments as possible so other people can understand it. Initial material is from the following article, the rest were based on assignments I found across the net relating to OS courses about writing shells.

# Features:
* Built-in functions (currently help, cd and exit)
* Displays current working directory
* Can launch programs
 
# Proposed Additions
* Adding command history
* Integrating a Ruby interpreter
* Adding unit test coverage (CMocka already set up)
